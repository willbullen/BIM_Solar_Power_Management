## Getting Started

The AI Agent Architect is accessible from the main dashboard via the "AI Agent" menu item in the side navigation. The interface is divided into several main areas:

- **Chat Interface**: For direct interaction with the AI Agent
- **Task Management**: For creating, monitoring, and managing AI tasks
- **Configuration**: For customizing the AI Agent's behavior and settings
- **Notifications**: For receiving alerts and updates from the AI Agent

## Chat Interface

The chat interface allows you to have natural language conversations with the AI Agent.

### Features

- **Conversation History**: Your chat history is organized into conversations, which can be accessed from the sidebar.
- **New Conversation**: Start a new conversation by clicking the "+" button in the conversations sidebar.
- **Message Input**: Type your messages in the input box at the bottom of the chat interface.
- **Function Execution**: The AI can execute various functions like data analysis or generating reports during conversations.
- **Data Access**: The AI has secure access to your energy and environmental data, allowing it to provide contextual insights.

### Tips for Effective Communication

- **Be Specific**: When asking questions, provide specific time periods or metrics you're interested in.
- **Ask for Analysis**: Request specific types of analysis, such as trend analysis, correlation studies, or anomaly detection.
- **Ask for Recommendations**: The AI can provide actionable recommendations for improving energy efficiency.
- **Multi-turn Conversations**: You can have extended conversations with follow-up questions and refinements.

### Example Prompts

- "Analyze yesterday's power consumption and compare it to the same day last week."
- "What environmental factors most strongly correlate with our solar output efficiency?"
- "Can you forecast our energy usage for the next 48 hours based on current patterns?"
- "Generate a report summarizing our energy consumption for equipment X over the past month."

## Task Management

The Task Management interface allows you to create, monitor, and manage longer-running AI tasks.

### Features

- **Task Creation**: Create new tasks with specific objectives, priorities, and parameters.
- **Task Monitoring**: Monitor the status and progress of ongoing tasks.
- **Task History**: Access completed tasks and their results.
- **Task Categories**: Tasks are organized by category (Analysis, Report, Prediction, etc.)

### Task Types

1. **Analysis Tasks**: In-depth analysis of your energy and environmental data
2. **Reporting Tasks**: Generation of structured reports for stakeholders
3. **Prediction Tasks**: Forward-looking forecasts and predictions
4. **Monitoring Tasks**: Continuous monitoring for specific conditions or anomalies
5. **Optimization Tasks**: Recommendations for optimizing energy consumption

### Creating a New Task

1. Navigate to the Tasks tab
2. Click "Create New Task"
3. Select the task type
4. Fill in the required parameters (time period, specific equipment, metrics, etc.)
5. Set the priority and schedule (if applicable)
6. Submit the task

### Task Status Indicators

- **Pending**: Task is queued but not yet started
- **In Progress**: Task is currently being processed
- **Completed**: Task has finished successfully
- **Failed**: Task encountered an error and could not complete
- **Cancelled**: Task was manually cancelled

## Agent Configuration

The Configuration interface allows you to customize the AI Agent's behavior and settings.

### Configuration Categories

#### AI Model
- **Model Selection**: Choose between different AI models with varying capabilities
- **Temperature**: Adjust the creativity vs. determinism of responses
- **Max Tokens**: Control response length limits
- **Response Format**: Set preferred output formats (text, JSON, markdown)

#### API Configuration
- **API Credentials**: Manage OpenAI and other API credentials
- **Rate Limiting**: Configure usage limits to manage costs
- **Proxy Settings**: Set up API proxies if needed

#### Function Registry
- **Available Functions**: View and manage the functions available to the AI
- **Function Permissions**: Configure which functions are available to different user roles
- **Custom Functions**: Add or modify custom functions for the AI to use

#### Agent Behavior
- **System Message**: Customize the AI's initial context and instructions
- **Knowledge Base**: Manage the AI's access to specific knowledge resources
- **Conversation Context**: Configure how much conversation history the AI considers
- **Data Access**: Manage which data sources the AI can access

## Notifications

The notification system keeps you informed about important events, alerts, and completed tasks.

### Notification Types

1. **Alerts**: Urgent notifications about anomalies or issues detected
2. **Task Notifications**: Updates about task status changes
3. **Reports**: Scheduled or requested reports
4. **System Notifications**: Information about system status or configuration changes

### Notification Management

- **Notification Center**: Access all notifications from the bell icon in the top navigation bar
- **Notification Settings**: Configure which notifications you receive and how
- **Read/Unread Status**: Track which notifications you've already viewed
- **Notification Actions**: Take direct actions from notification cards

## Multi-Capability Planning (MCP)

The Multi-Capability Planning (MCP) system coordinates complex, multi-step tasks across different AI capabilities.

### MCP Features

- **Task Scheduling**: Schedule tasks to run at specific times or intervals
- **Task Dependencies**: Define tasks that depend on the completion of other tasks
- **Capability Integration**: Combine multiple AI capabilities for more complex analyses
- **Workflow Automation**: Create automated workflows for common analytical tasks

### MCP Capabilities

1. **Data Analysis**: Advanced statistical analysis of energy and environmental data
2. **Natural Language Processing**: Extraction of insights from unstructured data
3. **Computer Vision**: Analysis of visual data from equipment or monitoring systems
4. **Time Series Forecasting**: Advanced predictive modeling for energy usage
5. **Optimization**: Mathematical optimization for energy efficiency

## Advanced Features

### REST API Integration
- The AI Agent uses optimized REST API endpoints instead of WebSockets for more reliable communication
- Real-time updates are achieved through efficient polling with exponential backoff
- This approach ensures greater stability across various network conditions

### Sentiment Analysis
- The AI can analyze the sentiment and tone of communications
- Useful for monitoring customer satisfaction and feedback
- Can be combined with other analyses for more context-aware insights

### Summarization
- Automatic summarization of long reports or conversations
- Creates executive summaries of complex analyses
- Can generate bullet-point summaries for quick review

### Proactive Insights
- The AI periodically generates insights without explicit prompting
- Identifies patterns, anomalies, or opportunities automatically
- Sends notifications with actionable insights

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Agent Not Responding
- Check your internet connection
- Verify API credentials are valid and have sufficient quota
- Ensure the AI model is configured correctly

#### Function Execution Errors
