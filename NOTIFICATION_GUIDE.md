  body: JSON.stringify({
    title: 'Custom Alert',
    message: 'This is a custom notification message',
    type: 'alert',
    priority: 'high',
    userId: 1
  })
});
```

## Notification Workflow Integration

The notification system integrates with other system workflows:

### AI Agent Integration

- Receive notifications when complex tasks complete
- Get alerts about task failures or issues

### Data Monitoring Integration
- Receive alerts when metrics exceed thresholds
- Get notifications about data quality issues
- Receive updates on system performance metrics

## Best Practices

### Configuring Notifications
1. **Focus on Important Notifications**: Configure settings to prioritize critical notifications
2. **Use Filters Effectively**: Set up filters to see the most relevant notifications
3. **Set Appropriate Thresholds**: Adjust alert thresholds to avoid notification fatigue
