- [x] Improve Environment tab with detailed weather forecasts
  - [x] Add comprehensive weather parameter visualization
  - [x] Add min/max value indicators
  - [x] Create visual timeline of expected conditions

### Stage 6: Advanced Features (If Time Permits)
- [ ] Implement Dynamic Operational Scheduling Advisor
