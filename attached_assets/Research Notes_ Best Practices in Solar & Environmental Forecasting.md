## Synthesized Best Practices Relevant to Emporium Dashboard & Solcast Integration:

Based on the review of GET.transform, IEA-PVPS, and NREL resources, the following best practices are particularly relevant for enhancing the Emporium Power Monitoring Dashboard using Solcast API:

1.  **Prioritize High-Quality Input Data:** Leverage Solcast's satellite-derived irradiance and weather data, which aligns with industry best practices for sourcing reliable solar resource information. Ensure correct site parameters (latitude, longitude, PV system specifics like tilt, azimuth, capacity) are used when querying the Solcast API.

2.  **Embrace Probabilistic Forecasting:** Move beyond single-value forecasts. Utilize Solcast's P10, P50, and P90 estimates for PV power to provide users with a clear understanding of the forecast uncertainty and potential range of generation. This is crucial for informed decision-making.

3.  **Integrate Comprehensive Weather Parameters:** Don't just forecast PV output; also provide forecasts for key weather variables that influence both PV generation and energy demand (e.g., GHI, DNI, air temperature, cloud cover/opacity). Solcast provides these.

4.  **Focus on Actionable Insights:** Forecasts should lead to actionable recommendations. For example, if high solar generation is forecast, suggest shifting energy-intensive loads; if low generation and high demand are forecast, suggest conservation measures.

5.  **Validate and Calibrate:** Where possible, compare Solcast forecasts and live estimates with actual on-site measurements from the Emporium system. While Solcast data is highly reliable, this comparison can help identify site-specific issues or sensor drift over time. Use historical data for continuous model improvement if building any local hybrid models.

6.  **Clear Visualization of Data and Uncertainty:** Present forecast data and its inherent uncertainty in an intuitive way. Graphs with confidence bands (P10-P90 ranges) are a good practice. Clearly label data sources.

7.  **Consider Different Forecast Horizons:** Provide forecasts for various timeframes (e.g., intra-day, day-ahead, multi-day up to 7 days as offered by Solcast) to support different operational planning needs.

8.  **Maintain Data Quality Control for On-Site Sensors:** While relying on Solcast, ensure any on-site sensors (used for actuals) are well-maintained and calibrated to provide a reliable baseline for comparison and for capturing real-time operational data not covered by Solcast (e.g., actual load consumption).

9.  **User-Centric Design:** Ensure that the enhanced forecasting and live data features are presented in a way that is easily understandable and usable by the target user (factory owner), enabling them to make better energy management decisions without needing to be a meteorology expert.

10. **Regularly Review Forecast Performance:** Implement mechanisms to track the accuracy of the forecasts (e.g., Solcast P50 vs. actual generation) over time. This can help build user trust and identify any systematic biases.

These synthesized best practices will inform the brainstorming of innovative uses and the final compilation of enhancement prompts.
