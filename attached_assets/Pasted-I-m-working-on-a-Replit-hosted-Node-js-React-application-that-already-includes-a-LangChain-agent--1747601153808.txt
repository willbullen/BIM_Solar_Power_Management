I’m working on a Replit-hosted Node.js + React application that already includes a LangChain agent, a suite of tools, and Telegram-bot communication.

Goal: Create a new React page and corresponding backend endpoints that let users:

Schedule LangChain agent tasks via an interactive calendar UI (drag-and-drop, date/time pickers).

View, edit, and cancel scheduled tasks, showing status (pending, running, completed, failed).

Add new tools from any LangChain toolkit (ExampleToolkit.get_tools()) through a searchable dropdown.

Trigger tasks manually or automatically based on dependencies, using LangChain’s Plan-and-Execute task graph.

Send notifications and receive updates via Telegram chat, leveraging existing webhooks and stream-based message handling.

Requirements:

Use LangChain JS methods (@tool decorators, StructuredTool.from_function, toolkit get_tools()) to register tools dynamically.

Implement task scheduling on the backend (e.g., using langchain-agents’ Task Fetching Unit for parallel execution).

Store tasks persistently (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) and sync state with the UI in real time (WebSockets or polling).

Provide unit tests or code comments illustrating how to extend with new toolkits.

Ensure the page is styled consistently (use CSS modules or Tailwind) and optimized for mobile.

Suggested Extra Functionality:

Drag-and-Drop Calendar Interface (e.g., react-big-calendar).

Task Prioritization & Dependency Graph via LangChain Plan-and-Execute DAG.

Real-Time Updates with Socket.IO or similar WebSockets.

Authentication & Role-Based Access to secure scheduling features.

Plug-and-Play Tool Registration: dynamic JSON schema upload + Toolkit.get_tools().

Telegram Threaded Conversations using inline keyboards or message threads.

Implementation Considerations:

LangChain JS Setup: decorate or wrap functions, dynamically load toolkits.

Scheduling Backend: use node-cron for simple tasks or the Task Fetching Unit for dependency-aware flows.

React + Replit: scaffold components in Replit IDE, commit via GitHub integration, deploy with replit deploy.

Telegram Webhooks: reuse existing Express route, stream updates to LangChain agent.

Persistence: choose MongoDB Atlas or PostgreSQL (Supabase) for task storage and run history.

Assistant Workflow Instructions:

Persistence: Keep going until the job is completely solved before ending your turn. Never stop mid-solution; if more is needed, continue elaborating.

Use Tools, Don’t Guess: If you’re unsure about any code, file, or data, open it and inspect it—do not hallucinate or make unsupported assumptions.

Plan, Then Reflect: Before each tool invocation, outline your intended steps. After each tool call, review the result and explain how it affects your next move.

Begin any task by stating your plan, execute methodically, and conclude by reflecting on what you learned and any next steps.
