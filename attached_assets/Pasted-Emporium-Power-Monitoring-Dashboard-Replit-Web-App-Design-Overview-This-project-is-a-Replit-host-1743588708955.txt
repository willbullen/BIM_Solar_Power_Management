Emporium Power Monitoring Dashboard (Replit Web App Design)
Overview
This project is a Replit-hosted web application for power monitoring and analysis. It uses the HUD Bootstrap 5 Admin Template for a modern, responsive UI and includes features such as:
•	Authentication with Roles: A login interface distinguishing Admin users from Viewer users, controlling access to settings.
•	Dashboard Visualizations: Interactive charts and summary cards for:
o	Main power supply (grid import/export readings)
o	Solar PV system output
o	Three-phase heavy consumers (e.g. refrigeration, heating, air compressors, smokers)
o	Derived metrics (unaccounted consumption, inefficiencies, savings)
•	Settings Panel: Admin-only controls to switch between live data vs synthetic data mode, and to select synthetic scenario profiles (e.g. Sunny High PV, Cloudy Low PV, Peak Load).
•	Data Integration: Fetches live data from the on-site Emporium power monitor (if an API or data feed is available), or falls back to simulated data feeds. Also integrates environmental data (sunlight, cloud cover, temperature) via public APIs to correlate weather with solar performance.
•	Guidance & Insights: Provides tips or analytics insights based on the data (e.g. highlighting inefficiencies or suggesting optimal usage times).
The result will be a polished, implementation-ready dashboard app with consistent HUD theme styling, responsive design, and clear component structure.
UI Framework and Template Integration
We will base the front-end on the HUD Admin Template (Bootstrap 5 based) to ensure a professional look-and-feel. To include the HUD theme assets in Replit’s HTML/CSS/JS setup:
•	Include CSS/JS: Add links to the HUD core CSS and JS in the HTML <head> and <body> as instructed by the theme documentation
file-kpheon6k5gvmhx19ys1vgk

file-kpheon6k5gvmhx19ys1vgk
. For example:
html
CopyEdit
<!-- Core CSS (HUD Theme) -->
<link href="assets/css/vendor.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<link href="assets/css/app.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<!-- ... -->
<!-- Core JS (HUD Theme) -->
<script src="assets/js/vendor.min.js"></script>
<script src="assets/js/app.min.js"></script>
These files (provided as app.min.css/app.min.js) contain the Bootstrap 5 styles and HUD’s custom styles/scripts.
•	Layout Structure: Follow HUD’s prescribed HTML structure for the app container, header, sidebar, and content. The main wrapper is a <div id="app" class="app"> containing the header, sidebar, and content sections
seantheme.com
. For example:
html
CopyEdit
<body>
  <div id="app" class="app">
    <!-- Header -->
    <header id="header" class="app-header"> ... </header>
    <!-- Sidebar -->
    <aside id="sidebar" class="app-sidebar"> ... </aside>
    <!-- Content Area -->
    <div id="content" class="app-content"> ... </div>
    <!-- Scroll-to-top Button, etc. -->
  </div>
</body>
Using this structure ensures the HUD theme’s CSS applies correctly to the header, sidebar, and content areas. (The HUD docs illustrate this required markup
seantheme.com
.)
•	Responsive Behavior: The HUD template is built to be fully responsive (leveraging Bootstrap 5). On smaller screens, the sidebar can collapse into a overlay or off-canvas menu. We will use HUD’s built-in classes (e.g. adding app-sidebar-collapsed to <div id="app" ...> if needed) to enable mobile-friendly behavior
file-kpheon6k5gvmhx19ys1vgk

file-kpheon6k5gvmhx19ys1vgk
. No extra CSS media queries should be needed; we rely on the theme’s grid and utility classes for layout.
•	Theming and Components: We’ll use HUD’s design system for UI components: form controls, buttons, modals, etc., to maintain a consistent look. HUD includes integrations for icons (FontAwesome is bundled
seantheme.com
), charts (Chart.js or ApexCharts) and other widgets, which we will leverage for building the dashboard interface.
Layout & Navigation
The app will have a dashboard page and a settings page/panel, with navigation accessible typically via the sidebar (and possibly header). Key elements of the layout include:
•	App Header (Navbar): A top navigation bar with the site title (e.g. Emporium Dashboard), and possibly a user menu (showing logged-in user/role with a logout button). The HUD app-header can be used to style this. It will also contain a toggle button for collapsing the sidebar on mobile (often an icon that triggers adding/removing a CSS class on the app to hide the sidebar). The header remains fixed at top for easy access.
•	Sidebar Menu: A vertical navigation menu in the app-sidebar section. This will list at minimum:
o	Dashboard – linking to the main dashboard view.
o	Settings – linking to the settings panel/page (admin only).
o	(Optional additional links like Reports or About, if needed.)
We will use the HUD/Bootstrap 5 sidebar styling: likely a <nav class="sidebar-nav"> with <ul class="nav"> items. Each item can have an icon (using FontAwesome or theme icons) and label. The “Settings” link will be shown only to admins (the app can render it conditionally based on user role).
•	Main Content Area: The <div id="content" class="app-content"> is where page-specific content renders. In dashboard view, this area will display the various cards, charts, and tables for power data. In the settings view, it will contain toggles and scenario controls. The content area will scroll independently if needed, and HUD provides a scroll-to-top button by default
seantheme.com
.
•	Footer (if needed): HUD may not require a footer inside app-content, but if needed we can include a small footer or attribution bar at the bottom of content. Otherwise, the scroll-to-top button provided by HUD covers basic navigation back to top.
All pages share the same header/sidebar, with only the content section swapping based on navigation (we can implement this as single-page app using JavaScript to swap views, or as multi-page where navigation loads different HTML content sections). Given Replit’s simple setup, a single-page app using dynamic DOM updates or hidden divs for different views is feasible.
Authentication & User Roles
We will implement a basic authentication flow to support Admin and Viewer roles:
•	Login Interface: On first load, if not authenticated, the app shows a login screen. This can be a centered card or modal dialog with fields for username and password. We will style it using Bootstrap 5 forms (which HUD’s CSS will enhance). For example, a simple login form:
html
CopyEdit
<div class="card login-card">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h4 class="card-title text-center">Sign In</h4>
    <form id="loginForm">
      <div class="mb-3">
        <label class="form-label">Username</label>
        <input type="text" class="form-control" name="username" required>
      </div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        <label class="form-label">Password</label>
        <input type="password" class="form-control" name="password" required>
      </div>
      <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary w-100">Login</button>
    </form>
  </div>
</div>
We can create two example accounts: admin (with admin role) and viewer (with viewer role), with preset passwords (since this is a prototype, hard-coding or simple check in JS is acceptable). On form submission, the credentials are checked against these presets. If valid, store the user role (e.g. localStorage.setItem('role', 'admin') or in a global JS variable) and proceed to show the main app UI. If invalid, show an error (e.g. a red alert message).
•	Role-Based UI Control: After login, the app UI adapts based on role:
o	If the user is Admin, they have full access. The Settings menu/link is visible. On the dashboard, admin might also see more detailed data or editing capabilities (for example, the ability to acknowledge alerts or add notes, if that were a feature).
o	If the user is Viewer, certain controls are hidden or disabled. The Settings menu might be hidden from the sidebar. If a viewer somehow navigates to settings, the toggles could be read-only or the page will instruct them that admin access is required. Essentially, viewers get a read-only view of the dashboard data.
•	Session Handling: Since this is a front-end focused app (on Replit), we will not implement a full secure session backend. Instead, a simple approach is to keep the user “logged in” by storing a flag in sessionStorage or localStorage and checking it on page load. In a real deployment, one would integrate a proper authentication service or server-side session. For our purposes, storing the role and perhaps a token in the browser is sufficient.
•	Logout: Provide a logout action (maybe as a header button or in a user menu) that clears the stored login info and reloads the app to show the login screen again.
This basic authentication setup will let us demonstrate role-based content (admin vs viewer) as required. The styling of the login form and any auth-related modals will be done to match HUD’s theme (using its classes for buttons, forms, etc., as shown above).
Dashboard Components & Data Visualization
Once logged in, the main Dashboard view presents a comprehensive overview of power data. We will compose this dashboard from several UI components, all styled with HUD/Bootstrap classes for consistency:
•	Summary Cards for Key Metrics: At the top, display a set of statistic cards highlighting current values:
o	Main Supply (Grid import/export): Show the current power draw from or feed to the grid (in kW). If the system supports it, this could show import vs export or net usage. For example, a card titled "Main Supply" containing a large numeric value (e.g. 3.5 kW) and a subtitle "Grid Power Now". We can use a colored indicator (green if exporting power back to grid, red if importing, etc.).
o	Solar PV Output: Current solar generation in kW. Another card showing e.g. 2.1 kW with subtitle "Solar PV Output". Possibly include an icon (like a sun) or small sparkline of generation over the last hour.
o	Major Load Circuits: We might have one card for each major 3-phase load or group them if many. For example, “Refrigeration Load” showing current draw (e.g. 1.2 kW), “Heating Load”, “Air Compressor”, etc. If we have multiple, we can arrange them in a grid. Each card can have a descriptive title and current power consumption. Alternatively, if there are many circuits, we might use a single card that lists each with a smaller font, or use a collapsible panel. But assuming only a few key categories, individual cards make the data glanceable.
o	Unaccounted Consumption: A card to show power that is not accounted by known categories. If the Emporium system measures total usage and we sum all monitored loads plus solar, any difference could be “unaccounted”. This might be displayed as “Other Consumption: X kW” or “Unaccounted: Y kW”. If this number is large, it might signal an issue. We can highlight it perhaps in a warning style if above a threshold.
o	Efficiency/Savings: A card or set of small cards for calculated metrics:
	Efficiency: If we define an efficiency metric (perhaps ratio of useful output vs input, or solar utilization percentage), we could show it as a percentage. For instance, “Solar Contribution: 40%” (meaning 40% of current power is from PV) or an overall system efficiency number.
	Savings: If solar or other measures saved energy/cost, show “Savings: X kWh (today)” or “Cost Savings: €Y today”. This requires some baseline (like if no solar, all that energy would come from grid – the difference is savings). Even if approximate, it provides a tangible insight for the user.
These cards will use the Bootstrap 5 card component with HUD’s styling. For example, a simplified HTML for the Solar PV card:
html
CopyEdit
<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 mb-3">  <!-- responsive column -->
  <div class="card bg-light">
    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">Solar PV Output</h5>
      <p id="solarOutput" class="display-6 fw-bold">0.0 kW</p>
      <small class="text-muted">Current solar generation</small>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
This shows a card with a light background (to distinguish, or we could use default white), a title, a large number (using Bootstrap display-6 class for a big font, and fw-bold for bold), and a muted subtitle. The IDs (like solarOutput) allow us to inject live values via JavaScript.
•	Interactive Charts: Below the summary cards, provide charts to visualize data over time and compare values:
o	A line chart (using Chart.js or ApexCharts, included via HUD’s vendor scripts) showing power trends over time. For example, time on the X-axis (past 24 hours or selected range) and multiple lines for:
	Solar PV output (kW)
	Main supply draw (kW)
	Perhaps each major consumer (so we can see how each contributes over time).
	Optionally, battery or grid export if relevant (not mentioned, but if main can be negative when exporting solar).
This chart gives a visual correlation: e.g. when solar (yellow line) goes up at midday, grid (blue line) goes down, etc. It can also highlight peak consumption periods. We will style the chart with theme colors – the HUD template likely provides a set of color variables. Chart.js can be configured to use a matching palette. For consistency, we may use a light background and colored lines with appropriate legends.
Implementation: include a <canvas id="powerChart"></canvas> in the HTML. In app.min.js or our custom JS, initialize the chart. For example:
js
CopyEdit
const ctx = document.getElementById('powerChart').getContext('2d');
const powerChart = new Chart(ctx, {
  type: 'line',
  data: {
    labels: [],  // time labels
    datasets: [
      { label: 'Main Supply', data: [], borderColor: '#007bff', fill: false },
      { label: 'Solar PV', data: [], borderColor: '#28a745', fill: false },
      // ... other datasets
    ]
  },
  options: {
    responsive: true,
    scales: { x: { type: 'time', time: { unit: 'hour' } }, y: { title: { text: 'kW', display: true } } }
  }
});
We will update data.datasets[..].data periodically (for live mode) or load them from synthetic scenario data. The chart auto-updates when data is changed and update() is called.
o	Possibly a bar chart or pie chart for distribution of consumption: e.g. a pie chart showing the percentage of total power each category (refrigeration, heating, etc.) is consuming at the moment or averaged over the day. This gives a quick sense of where energy is going. Using Chart.js, a doughnut chart could be appropriate. We would style it with distinct colors per category, possibly with labels or a legend. This chart would be updated when data changes (in synthetic mode, whenever scenario changes; in live mode, perhaps periodically for current distribution).
o	If needed, additional charts or tables can be added: for example, a table of historical daily totals, or a comparison of week vs week. However, to keep scope focused, the above charts suffice to cover real-time and breakdown views.
•	Environmental Data Display: To reinforce the correlation between environment and solar performance, we will also show current environmental metrics:
o	Sunlight Intensity: e.g. display the current solar irradiance or a qualitative “sunny/cloudy” indicator. This could be a small badge or icon (sun icon if clear, cloud icon if overcast) with a description like “Sunlight: 800 W/m²” or “Sunny (90% sun)”. If we have a continuous value (W/m² from API), we can show that numerically.
o	Cloud Cover: show as a percentage or description (e.g. “Cloud Cover: 10% – Clear”). This helps explain dips in solar output on the chart.
o	Temperature: optionally display ambient temperature (since temperature might affect solar panel efficiency and also correlates with heating/cooling loads). For example, “Outside Temp: 18°C”.
These could be shown in a small weather widget area on the dashboard, perhaps as part of the header of the dashboard or a sidebar widget. Another approach is integrating into the chart (for instance, showing sun intensity as a background area on the solar chart), but that complicates visualization. Simpler is just to list current values or have a mini-chart for sun intensity over the day. We will likely display them as text/icons for clarity.
•	Insights/Guidance Panel: At the bottom or side of the dashboard, include a panel for analytics insights. This will contain dynamically generated tips based on the data. For example:
o	If unaccounted consumption is high: “⚠️ Unaccounted usage is high (5 kW). You may have devices consuming power that are not monitored – consider checking for any equipment left on or mis-measured.”
o	If solar contribution is low due to clouds: “☁️ It’s cloudy now, so solar output is reduced. If you have flexible loads, you might delay them until brighter conditions to maximize solar usage.”
o	If a particular load (say refrigeration) is running inefficiently (perhaps using more power than usual): “📈 Refrigeration power usage is 15% above normal. Ensure doors are closed and system is functioning properly to avoid energy waste.”
o	If solar is providing a large portion of power: “🌞 Solar is covering 70% of current usage, saving approximately 5 kW from the grid. Great job utilizing renewable energy – estimated €X saved today.”
These insights make the dashboard actionable. We can implement this as a simple block of text that updates whenever new data comes in. We might style it as an alert/info box (using Bootstrap alert classes). For example:
html
CopyEdit
<div id="insightsPanel" class="alert alert-info">
  <!-- dynamic tips will be inserted here -->
</div>
The content can be a list of bullet points or just paragraphs. We ensure the style matches the theme (HUD will style .alert to fit in nicely).
Responsive layout note: The dashboard will be arranged using Bootstrap grid (as shown with col-md-3 col-sm-6 for cards, etc.) so that on smaller screens, cards and charts stack vertically. The charts will resize (Chart.js is responsive by default). The sidebar will collapse to an icon-only or hidden state, and the header will likely remain visible with perhaps a menu button for sidebar. All text should remain readable on mobile. We will test the layout at different breakpoints.
Settings Panel (Live Data Toggle & Scenario Selection)
The Settings section of the app allows an admin to configure the data source and scenario. This will be accessible typically via the sidebar (click "Settings" navigates to a settings page, or could open an off-canvas panel). For simplicity, we might implement it as a separate page under the same layout.
Key components in Settings:
•	Live Data Toggle: A switch input that lets the user choose between Live Data and Synthetic Data. We’ll label it clearly (e.g. “Use Live Data” on/off). When toggled off, the app uses synthetic (simulated) data; when on, it fetches live data from the actual monitoring system. In HTML, this can be a checkbox with type="checkbox" and data-bs-toggle="switch" (if HUD provides a fancy switch, or simply styled as a Bootstrap 5 switch):
html
CopyEdit
<div class="form-check form-switch">
  <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" id="liveDataToggle" />
  <label class="form-check-label" for="liveDataToggle">Live Data</label>
</div>
This uses the Bootstrap 5 switch style (the form-switch class) to render a toggle slider. We’ll attach a JS event listener to #liveDataToggle to handle mode switching:
o	If turned ON: attempt to fetch live data (enable API calls, disable scenario selection UI).
o	If turned OFF: use synthetic data (stop or ignore live API calls, enable scenario dropdown to pick a scenario).
•	Scenario Dropdown: When synthetic data mode is active, the admin can choose a scenario that defines typical conditions. Provide a dropdown (<select>) or a set of radio buttons listing scenarios such as:
o	"High PV Output (Sunny Day)"
o	"Low PV Output (Cloudy Day)"
o	"Peak Load Day"
o	(Potentially more, e.g. “Normal Day” or “Custom”)
Using a select for simplicity:
html
CopyEdit
<label for="scenarioSelect" class="form-label mt-3">Synthetic Scenario:</label>
<select id="scenarioSelect" class="form-select" style="max-width: 300px;">
  <option value="sunny">Sunny Day – High PV Output</option>
  <option value="cloudy">Cloudy Day – Low PV Output</option>
  <option value="peak">Peak Load Day</option>
</select>
This dropdown should be disabled/greyed out if the Live Data toggle is ON, since scenarios apply only to synthetic mode. We can manage that with JS (e.g., scenarioSelect.disabled = liveToggle.checked and toggle it on change).
•	Scenario Definitions: We will have predefined data profiles for each scenario:
o	Sunny Day: Simulate a day with clear sky – solar generation peaks near midday (e.g. reaching near system max, say 100% at noon), low cloud cover, maybe moderate temperature. Consumption might be average unless specified otherwise.
o	Cloudy Day: Solar generation is much lower (perhaps capped at 30% of max), shaped by intermittent clouds. Cloud cover high, maybe slightly lower temp. Perhaps the grid consumption is higher due to low solar.
o	Peak Load Day: Overall consumption is high (maybe certain loads are running at max or concurrently). Possibly this is during a period where solar might also be available or maybe it’s a winter day with low solar but high heating usage. The scenario could assume lower solar output (due to season or weather) and multiple loads on, leading to a high peak demand from grid.
We will represent these scenarios in the code as data sets (e.g. an array of hourly values for each relevant parameter). For example, for “Sunny Day”, an array for solar PV like [0,0,0.5, 2, 5, 8, 10, 9, 6, 3, 1, 0] kW over 12 hours (just conceptual), whereas “Cloudy Day” might be [0,0,0.2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.5, 0] etc. Similarly, we define consumption curves for each load in those scenarios. These can be hardcoded or generated via function when scenario is selected.
•	Live Data Configuration: If the monitoring system’s API requires an endpoint URL or API key, the settings panel could include fields to configure those (for example, an input for “Device API URL” or keys). However, since Emporium (Emporia) doesn’t have an open API yet
help.emporiaenergy.com
, we might not expose any in the UI. Instead, our code will contain the logic for live data (attempting to call a known endpoint or cloud service if available). If a future API becomes available, this section can be expanded.
•	Environment Data Toggle (if needed): We could have an additional toggle to include real environmental data even when using synthetic power data. But this might be unnecessary. Likely, if synthetic mode is on, environment data is also synthetic (predefined in scenario). If live mode is on, we fetch actual environment data from APIs. This can be automatic without user toggle, so probably no need for a separate control.
The settings panel itself will be styled using the HUD theme (form controls, etc., already styled by app.min.css). We ensure a clean layout, e.g. using <div class="container"> or similar inside the content to align the form elements nicely, perhaps with headings or separators between sections (like a subtitle “Data Source” above the toggle, and “Synthetic Scenario” above the dropdown).
When the admin changes any setting:
•	If switching to Live Data: the app will start fetching from the live data source (and possibly refresh the dashboard immediately with latest live values).
•	If switching to Synthetic: the app will stop live updates and instead load the selected scenario’s dataset (e.g., populate the charts and values with the synthetic data series).
•	If changing the Scenario while synthetic is active: the dashboard recalculates to reflect the new scenario (update all cards and charts accordingly).
These changes should happen in real-time to give immediate feedback.
Data Sources and Integration
Live Data from Emporium System: The Emporium (Emporia) power monitoring system installed on-site would ideally provide an API or data feed to retrieve current and historical power measurements. However, according to the manufacturer, no public API is available at this time
help.emporiaenergy.com
. In lieu of an official API, there are community-driven solutions (e.g. the PyEmVue Python library and Home Assistant integrations
help.emporiaenergy.com
) that can pull data from the Emporia cloud. In a Replit environment (which is basically a web app without a persistent server by default), integrating directly with those might be difficult.
For our app, we have a couple of approaches for live data:
•	Simulated API Endpoints: We can create a small backend within Replit (for example, using a Flask or Node.js server in Replit) that either fetches data from the Emporium system or returns dummy data in the same format. The dashboard front-end would then call this backend (e.g. via AJAX/fetch) at regular intervals. If the Emporium system can push data to a known URL or if we have an export (CSV or MQTT feed), we could ingest that. Otherwise, this backend simply serves static sample data when queried.
•	Polling the Emporia Cloud (if credentials available): If we treat this as a real deployment scenario, an admin could provide their Emporia account credentials in the settings, and our app (backend) could use them with a library to fetch live readings. Given Emporia’s stance, this would rely on unofficial methods. For the scope here, we likely skip actual credential usage and stick to simulation.
Thus, the “Live Data” mode in our app will initially behave similar to a synthetic mode, except it might just fetch from an endpoint that we control. In summary, implementing true live data might be out-of-scope unless an API emerges. We’ll design the app such that switching to live data is possible in the future with minimal changes (just wiring the fetch to a real API).
Synthetic Data Implementation: In absence of real data, we will generate synthetic data that mimics realistic patterns:
•	We will create data arrays for each measurable (main supply, solar, each load) over a time period (e.g. 24 hours with 15-min intervals or hourly points). These will correspond to scenario conditions.
•	For instance, Sunny Day: Solar array starts at 6am, peaks at midday, goes to zero by evening. Loads might have their own schedule (refrigeration likely fairly steady with small oscillations, heating might spike in morning/evening, etc.). We ensure that main supply = (sum of loads – solar) for each interval, assuming solar first goes to loads then excess might go to grid (if any concept of export, but since not mentioned, we assume no exporting, or we treat main supply as net import).
•	Cloudy Day: Solar data is much lower (perhaps we apply a cloud factor to the Sunny profile). Loads might remain similar or slightly different (maybe on a cooler cloudy day, heating load is higher due to lower ambient temp).
•	Peak Load: We increase one or more loads significantly during certain hours (e.g. the compressor runs at max in the afternoon, or multiple machines run simultaneously). If this is a scenario separate from weather, could be combined with moderate solar. Possibly this scenario could be “winter peak” with very low solar + high heating.
The synthetic environmental data (sun intensity, etc.) will be consistent with these scenarios. For example, in code we might define:
js
CopyEdit
const scenarios = {
  sunny: {
    solar: [0,0,..., 80, 90, 100, 90, 50, ... 0],  // % of max or actual kW
    cloudCover: [0,0,..., 5, 10, 5, 0, 0,...],    // low %
    temp: [15, 15,..., 22, 25, 24, 20, 18,...]    // °C over the day
    // and load profiles, main supply etc.
  },
  cloudy: {
    solar: [0,..., 20, 30, 25, 10, ... 0],
    cloudCover: [50,..., 80, 90, 70, 60,...],
    temp: [16,..., 20, 22, 21, 19,...]
    // ...
  },
  peak: {
    solar: [0,..., 50, 60, 55, 40,..., 0],  // maybe winter sun lower
    cloudCover: [20,..., 30, 20,...],
    temp: [10,..., 15, 18, 16,...],        // cooler day
    // loads significantly higher at certain times
  }
};
And so on. These values can be somewhat arbitrary but should present realistic behavior (no negative solar, etc.). The dashboard will use these to populate the charts and current values. The unaccounted consumption in synthetic mode can be explicitly calculated if we want to simulate some unmeasured loads (e.g. define that only 90% of total is accounted by listed consumers, leaving 10% unaccounted).
•	Data Refresh Rate: In live mode, if we had a real API, we’d perhaps poll every 5 seconds for current values and every minute for detailed series, or use a WebSocket push if available. For simulation, we can simply loop through the dataset as if time is passing (e.g. increment an index every second to simulate real-time progression through a day). Alternatively, for simplicity, we may just display one full day graph at once rather than real-time animation, since the focus is on scenario visualization.
Environmental Data from Public APIs: For live mode (and possibly to generate synthetic with realism), we will integrate with reliable public data sources for weather metrics at Southwest Kerry, Ireland (a coastal region). Key considerations are low latency (fast response) and open access (no complex API auth if possible). Two good options are:
•	Open-Meteo API: An open and free weather API that provides JSON data for any location without requiring an API key. Open-Meteo supports a wide range of weather variables, including solar radiation, cloud cover, and temperature
open-meteo.com
. We can use the latitude/longitude of the site in Kerry and request hourly or current data. For instance, an Open-Meteo query can return “shortwave radiation” (global solar irradiance in W/m²), cloud cover percentage, and temperature in °C. This service is fast and allows up to 10,000 calls per day for free
open-meteo.com
– easily sufficient for a live dashboard (even polling every minute is 1440 calls per day). We can call it client-side via fetch (since it’s CORS-enabled) or via a backend proxy if needed. Example usage:
bash
CopyEdit
GET https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=51.9&longitude=-10.2
    &hourly=temperature_2m,cloudcover,shortwave_radiation&current_weather=true
This would return JSON including current_weather with temperature and other fields, and an hourly time series for cloudcover and radiation.
•	OpenWeatherMap API: The OpenWeatherMap One Call API provides current and forecast data including cloud coverage and temperature for any location (API key required, but a free tier is available). Additionally, OWM offers a Solar Radiation API that can give solar irradiance and related parameters for a location
openweathermap.org
. However, the solar API may require a higher tier subscription. For basic needs, one could use current weather to estimate sunlight: e.g., if cloud cover is low and it's daytime, assume high irradiance, or use the “Clear Sky” solar radiation model OWM provides. Given the requirement for open access, OWM is an option if an API key is obtained, but otherwise Open-Meteo might be preferable for simplicity.
•	Met Éireann (Ireland’s Meteorological Service): Met Éireann provides an open-data API for weather forecasts
weather.apis.ie
. It can give a detailed point forecast in hourly intervals out to 90 hours for any lat/long in Ireland. This could be used to get cloud cover and temperature as well. However, the data is in XML and requires parsing, and possibly a proxy (since calling that from client-side might be tricky due to CORS or format). For a robust solution specifically in Ireland, this is a reliable source, but integration effort is higher. Still, it’s worth noting as an available resource for local accuracy.
In our application, we will likely utilize Open-Meteo for live environmental data due to ease of use and no key needed. When in live data mode, upon each data refresh cycle, we can also call the weather API to get the current conditions. The returned sunlight (irradiance) value can be compared with the measured solar output to ensure consistency, and cloud cover can be displayed. In synthetic mode, we’ll use the scenario’s built-in environment data rather than calling the API (though we could still fetch real weather to inform the scenario if we wanted hybrid mode).
By using these data sources, the dashboard not only shows raw numbers but can contextualize them with real-world conditions. For example, if live solar output is lower than expected given the sunlight data, that might indicate the solar panels are not performing optimally (dirty or malfunctioning). The app could potentially flag that as an insight (“Solar output is lower than typical for the current sun intensity”).
Implementation Notes & Component Structure
With the above design in mind, here’s how we can implement the app’s structure in Replit’s environment, focusing on clarity and using HUD’s components:
•	Project Structure: In Replit (using the HTML/CSS/JS starter), we will have:
o	index.html – contains the base HTML layout (including header, sidebar, content container, and placeholders for login form, dashboard, settings).
o	style.css – if needed for minor custom styling (most styling from HUD’s app.css so we keep custom CSS minimal).
o	script.js – custom JavaScript to handle dynamic behavior (authentication logic, fetching data, updating DOM elements, chart initialization, etc.).
o	assets/ folder – where we put the vendor.min.js, app.min.js, vendor.min.css, app.min.css files of HUD (already provided). Also fonts or icons if needed (HUD might require webfonts folder for FontAwesome, which we include).
o	Possibly a data/ folder for sample JSON (if we decide to store scenario data externally, or images if any).
•	HTML Layout Outline: In index.html, inside the body, we will probably include both the login form and the main app, showing one or the other based on state (could use a simple <div id="loginScreen"> and <div id="app" class="app"> and hide/show via script). For illustration, a simplified outline:
html
CopyEdit
<body>
  <!-- Login Screen -->
  <div id="loginScreen" class="d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center vh-100 bg-dark text-white">
    <!-- centered login form card as shown earlier -->
  </div>

  <!-- Main App -->
  <div id="app" class="app d-none"><!-- initially hidden until login -->
    <header id="header" class="app-header">
      <div class="navbar-brand">Emporium Dashboard</div>
      <div class="flex-grow-1"></div>
      <div class="dropdown user-menu">
        <!-- user name/role and logout -->
      </div>
    </header>
    <aside id="sidebar" class="app-sidebar">
      <nav class="sidebar-nav">
        <ul class="nav flex-column">
          <li class="nav-item"><a href="#" class="nav-link active" data-page="dashboard">
            <i class="fa fa-chart-bar"></i> Dashboard</a>
          </li>
          <li class="nav-item"><a href="#" class="nav-link" data-page="settings" id="settingsLink">
            <i class="fa fa-sliders-h"></i> Settings</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </aside>
    <div id="content" class="app-content">
      <!-- Dashboard Page -->
      <div id="dashboardPage">
        <div class="row">
          <!-- Card examples -->
          <div class="col-xl-3 col-md-6 mb-3">
            <div class="card">
              <div class="card-body">
                <h6 class="card-title">Main Supply</h6>
                <div class="display-5 fw-bold"><span id="mainSupplyVal">--</span> kW</div>
                <small class="text-muted">Grid draw now</small>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <!-- More cards for Solar, Loads, etc. -->
        </div>
        <div class="card mb-3">
          <div class="card-body">
            <canvas id="powerChart" height="120"></canvas>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div id="insightsPanel" class="alert alert-info">
          <!-- dynamic insights text -->
        </div>
      </div>
      <!-- Settings Page (hidden by default) -->
      <div id="settingsPage" class="d-none">
        <h4>Settings</h4>
        <div class="form-check form-switch mb-3">
          <input type="checkbox" class="form-check-input" id="liveDataToggle">
          <label class="form-check-label" for="liveDataToggle">Live Data</label>
        </div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          <label for="scenarioSelect" class="form-label">Synthetic Scenario:</label>
          <select id="scenarioSelect" class="form-select" style="max-width: 300px;">
            <option value="sunny">High PV Output (Sunny)</option>
            <option value="cloudy">Low PV Output (Cloudy)</option>
            <option value="peak">Peak Load Day</option>
          </select>
        </div>
        <!-- Possibly fields for API URL/Key if needed -->
        <p class="text-muted">* Changes will reflect immediately on the dashboard.</p>
      </div>
    </div> <!-- end content -->
    <!-- scroll-to-top button -->
    <a href="#" class="btn-scroll-top fade"><i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i></a>
  </div> <!-- end app -->
</body>
In the above structure, we use data-page attributes or separate divs for pages to toggle between Dashboard and Settings without reloading. The “Settings” link has an id="settingsLink" which our JS can use to show the settings page (settingsPage) and hide the dashboard (dashboardPage), and vice versa for the Dashboard link. The d-none class (Bootstrap utility) hides elements.
•	JavaScript Functionality: In script.js, we implement:
o	Login handling: Listen for form submit, check user/pw, set role, hide login, show main app (app.classList.remove('d-none')).
o	Navigation handling: When clicking sidebar links, toggle the content sections (dashboardPage, settingsPage). Also, if the user is viewer, we ensure settingsLink is hidden or disabled.
o	Data fetching/updating: Set up a mechanism to either fetch data or iterate through synthetic data. For synthetic:
	Perhaps have a function loadScenario(scenarioName) that loads the corresponding data arrays into the chart and updates the instantaneous values (e.g., take the last point as “current” or step through time).
	We can simulate time progression by using setInterval to update values every few seconds from the arrays.
	For live data: if we had an API, use fetch(url).then(response=>updateUI(response.json())). In absence, maybe call the same updateUI with random or static data.
o	Chart updates: Use Chart.js API to update datasets. For example, to update the chart continuously in synthetic mode, we might loop through the arrays, pushing new points onto the chart and shifting old ones off to mimic real-time streaming.
o	Toggle handling: When #liveDataToggle is changed:
	If now live: call a function startLiveUpdates().
	If now synthetic: call stopLiveUpdates() and loadScenario(selectedScenario).
	Also disable/enable the scenarioSelect accordingly.
o	Scenario select handling: On change, if synthetic mode is active, simply call loadScenario(newSelection).
o	Insights generation: After each data update (either via live fetch or synthetic progression), call a function generateInsights() that reads the current values (and maybe compares to historical or thresholds) and sets the innerHTML of #insightsPanel with appropriate messages. This could be as simple as a few if conditions for now.
•	Environmental data integration (live): If live mode and we have an environment API:
o	On each update, we can call e.g. Open-Meteo for current values. Example in code:
js
CopyEdit
fetch('https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=51.9&longitude=-10.2&current_weather=true&hourly=cloudcover,shortwave_radiation')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => {
     const curr = data.current_weather;
     // curr.temperature, etc.
     document.getElementById('weatherInfo').innerText = 
         `Sun: ${data.hourly.shortwave_radiation[0]} W/m², Clouds: ${data.hourly.cloudcover[0]}%`;
  });
(This is a simplistic approach; in practice we'd use the actual data properly and ensure we have the right index [0] meaning current hour, or use current_weather if it includes cloud info.)
o	We would display this in the UI, as mentioned, maybe in the dashboard header or as part of a weather widget section.
•	Polish and Testing: We will test the app in various scenarios:
o	Resize the browser to ensure the card grid wraps properly on smaller widths.
o	Toggle between scenarios and live mode to see that everything updates and nothing breaks (no undefined values, etc.).
o	Check that the HUD theme styling is intact: e.g., sidebar should appear with proper background, header should be styled (the classes app-header and app-sidebar handle that via HUD CSS).
o	Ensure that the color contrast is good (e.g., the light card variant or background choices make text legible).
o	Use the HUD theme’s utility classes or modifiers as needed. For example, the HUD docs mention a Light Mode and Dark Mode toggle; by default, we can use light theme (as seen by using bg-light on cards, etc., which presumes the app is in light mode).
Conclusion: By following this design, we end up with an implementation-ready structure. The combination of the HUD Bootstrap template for UI and charts, plus the logic for data handling (switchable between real and simulated data), will fulfill the requirements. The app will be easy to extend – for example, if an official Emporia API becomes available, we can plug it into the live data fetching part. Using public weather APIs like Open-Meteo ensures our solar data is contextualized with real environmental factors
open-meteo.com
, and the insights engine provides actionable information, not just raw data. Overall, this approach yields a robust, user-friendly dashboard for monitoring and optimizing power usage in South West Kerry (or any location with appropriate data inputs).

Extras:
1.	Add machine learning predictions for power usage optimization
2.	Implement anomaly detection for early warning system
3.	Create energy cost analysis and savings calculator
4.	Add automated reporting functionality with insights
