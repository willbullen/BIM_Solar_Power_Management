# Actionable Prompts for Enhancing Forecasting & Live Features with Solcast API

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a set of actionable prompts and recommendations to significantly enhance the forecasting and live data capabilities of your Emporium Power Monitoring Dashboard by integrating the Solcast API. Leveraging Solcast's high-fidelity solar irradiance, PV power, and weather data will enable more accurate predictions, richer real-time insights, and ultimately, better energy management decisions for the factory owner. These prompts are based on a review of the Solcast API, your application's current features, industry best practices, and innovative opportunities.

## 2. General Recommendations for Solcast API Integration

Before diving into specific feature enhancements, consider these foundational points for a successful Solcast API integration:

*   **API Key Management:** You mentioned you have a Solcast API key. Ensure this key is stored securely within your application's backend and is not exposed in client-side code. Refer to Solcast documentation for best practices on API key usage and authentication methods (e.g., Bearer Token in headers is generally preferred for server-to-server communication).
*   **Accurate Site Configuration:** The accuracy of Solcast data heavily relies on correct site parameters. Ensure the latitude, longitude, PV system capacity (kWp), tilt, azimuth, and any other relevant system details (e.g., specific Solcast resource ID if you have a registered site in their toolkit) are accurately configured when making API requests. This is crucial for both rooftop and advanced PV power forecasts.
*   **Understand Rate Limits & Subscription:** Be mindful of the API rate limits associated with your Solcast API key/subscription plan. Design your application's polling strategy for live data and forecast updates to stay within these limits. If higher frequency or more data points are needed, you might need to consider an appropriate paid subscription tier.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for API requests. This includes managing network issues, API errors (e.g., 401, 403, 429, 500), and parsing responses correctly. Provide graceful fallbacks or user notifications if Solcast data is temporarily unavailable.

## 3. Prompts for Enhancing Forecasting Features

These prompts draw from the detailed proposals in `proposed_forecasting_enhancements.md` and align with industry best practices.

### 3.1. Supercharge Solar Output & Load Forecasts

*   **Prompt:** Integrate Solcast's high-resolution PV power forecasts (P10, P50, P90) to replace or augment your current "Solar Output" forecast. Use Solcast's detailed weather forecasts (air temperature, cloud opacity, GHI, DNI, wind data) to refine your overall energy load forecasting model.
    *   **Action:** Utilize Solcast endpoints like `GET /data/forecast/rooftop_pv_power` (or `advanced_pv_power`) for PV forecasts, and `GET /data/forecast/radiation_and_weather` for weather data.
    *   **Benefit:** Significantly improves the accuracy of both solar generation and load forecasts, leading to better operational planning and cost optimization. Adopts best practice of using probabilistic forecasts (P10/P50/P90) for solar output.
    *   **Display:** Show P50 as the primary solar forecast, with the P10-P90 range visualized as a confidence band.

### 3.2. Extend Forecast Horizon & Detail

*   **Prompt:** Offer users extended forecast horizons (e.g., up to 7 days) for both PV generation and overall load, leveraging Solcast's capabilities. Provide a dedicated, detailed weather forecast view within the "Forecasting" section's "Environment" tab.
    *   **Action:** Query Solcast forecast endpoints for longer durations (e.g., `hours=168`). Display graphs for `air_temp`, `cloud_opacity`, `ghi`, `dni`, and `wind_speed_10m` over the selected horizon.
    *   **Benefit:** Enables better medium-term planning for energy procurement, production scheduling, and maintenance. Provides comprehensive weather context.

### 3.3. Enhance Forecast Visualization & Summaries

*   **Prompt:** Introduce a dedicated solar irradiance forecast graph (GHI, DNI). Expand the "Forecast Details" summary to include total expected solar generation (kWh), peak solar generation (kW and time), and a key weather summary for the forecast period.
    *   **Action:** Use `ghi` and `dni` from `GET /data/forecast/radiation_and_weather`. Calculate summary metrics from the detailed forecast data.
    *   **Benefit:** Offers deeper insights into solar resource availability and provides a quick, digestible summary of critical forecast metrics.

## 4. Prompts for Enhancing Live Features

These prompts draw from `proposed_live_feature_enhancements.md` and aim to improve the immediacy and accuracy of live data.

### 4.1. Augment "Current Metrics" & "Environment" with Solcast Live Data

*   **Prompt:** Use Solcast's live/estimated actuals for PV power to augment or validate the "Solar Output" in "Current Metrics." Enrich the "Environment" section with Solcast's live/recent `air_temp`, `ghi`, `dni`, `cloud_opacity`, and `wind_speed_10m`.
    *   **Action:** Utilize Solcast endpoints like `GET /data/live/rooftop_pv_power` (or `advanced_pv_power`) and `GET /data/live/radiation_and_weather` for the latest estimated actuals.
    *   **Benefit:** Provides more accurate, granular, and potentially faster-updating live environmental and solar generation data. Replaces generic "Sun Intensity %" with precise irradiance values (GHI, DNI).

### 4.2. Improve Live Dashboard Dynamics & Validation

*   **Prompt:** Increase the update frequency for solar-related metrics on the timeline graph if feasible within API limits. Introduce visual indicators for live solar conditions (e.g., dynamic sun icon based on GHI). Display on-site PV output alongside Solcast's live estimate for validation and trigger alerts on significant, persistent discrepancies.
    *   **Action:** Poll live Solcast endpoints at an optimal frequency. Compare Emporium's PV output with Solcast's `pv_estimate`.
    *   **Benefit:** Enhances real-time responsiveness, provides at-a-glance solar condition awareness, and enables quick identification of potential PV system or sensor issues.

## 5. Innovative & Advanced Enhancements (Future Considerations)

Consider these advanced features, inspired by `innovative_uses_solcast.md`, for future development to provide exceptional value:

*   **Dynamic Operational Scheduling Advisor:** Develop an intelligent advisor using Solcast's multi-day forecasts and (optional) user-defined machinery profiles to suggest optimal operational schedules for energy-intensive processes, maximizing solar self-consumption and minimizing costs.
*   **Advanced PV System Health & Degradation Monitoring:** Use Solcast's historical and ongoing data as a weather-normalized baseline to track long-term PV system performance, detect subtle degradation, and identify systemic issues earlier than conventional methods.

## 6. Key Best Practices for Implementation

Referencing `research_solar_forecasting_best_practices.md`, keep these principles in mind:

*   **Prioritize Data Quality:** Accurate site parameters for Solcast are paramount.
*   **Embrace Probabilistic Information:** Clearly communicate forecast uncertainty (e.g., P10-P90 ranges).
*   **Actionable Insights:** Ensure data leads to clear recommendations or aids decision-making.
*   **Validate & Calibrate:** Compare with on-site data where possible.
*   **User-Centric Design:** Present complex data intuitively.
*   **Monitor Forecast Performance:** Track accuracy over time to build trust and refine models if necessary.

## 7. Conclusion

By thoughtfully integrating the Solcast API using these prompts, the Emporium Power Monitoring Dashboard can evolve into a more powerful, accurate, and indispensable tool for the factory owner. These enhancements will provide deeper insights into energy generation and consumption patterns, enabling proactive management, cost savings, and improved operational efficiency.
