### Monitoring MCP Tasks

1. Navigate to the **Tasks** tab in the AI Agent interface
2. The task list shows all tasks with their current status
3. Click on any task to view details:
   - Status: Current state of the task
   - Progress: For long-running tasks
   - Subtasks: List of component tasks
   - Results: Results of completed tasks
   - Logs: Detailed logs of task execution

### Task Statuses

- **Pending**: Task is created but not yet started
- **Scheduled**: Task is scheduled for future execution
- **In Progress**: Task is currently being executed
- **Waiting**: Task is waiting for dependencies to complete
- **Completed**: Task has successfully completed
- **Failed**: Task encountered an error and could not complete
- **Cancelled**: Task was manually cancelled

## Best Practices

### When to Use MCP

MCP is most valuable for:

1. **Complex Multi-step Tasks**: Tasks that require multiple types of analysis
2. **Recurring Analysis**: Analyses that need to be performed regularly
3. **Dependent Workflows**: When one task's output feeds into another task
4. **Resource-intensive Operations**: Tasks that require significant computation
5. **Long-running Processes**: Tasks that take more than a few seconds to complete

### Defining Effective Tasks

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly define what you want to accomplish
2. **Set Appropriate Parameters**: Configure task parameters to get the results you need
3. **Use Reasonable Time Frames**: For data analysis, use time frames appropriate to the question
4. **Consider Dependencies**: Define any dependencies between tasks
5. **Set Appropriate Priorities**: Use priorities to ensure important tasks are executed first

### Interpreting Results

1. **Check Completion Status**: Ensure all subtasks completed successfully
2. **Review Summary First**: Start with the executive summary or overview
3. **Examine Visualizations**: Visual representations often provide quick insights
4. **Consider Context**: Interpret results in the context of your business
5. **Follow Up on Recommendations**: Take action on the recommendations provided

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Task Stuck in "Pending" Status
- Check if the system is currently busy with higher-priority tasks
- Verify that all required parameters are provided
- Check system resources (the task may be waiting for available resources)

#### Task Failed
- Check the error message in the task details
- Verify that all parameters are valid
- Check if referenced data exists for the specified time period
- Ensure dependencies completed successfully
